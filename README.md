#Magic of Revolt
Welcome to the Github repostery for Magic of Revolt. Magic of Revolt is a Minecraft mod centered around the magic system of the fictional realm Revolt. 

#####Was it influenced by Vazkii's mod Psi?
In a way, yes. I guess you could say that Psi made me realize and see the magic system of revolt in another way, and what that actually meant. I can however say that it was not something like, "Hey, That magic system looks cool, that's now what they use in Revolt".

Magic of Revolt is currently in very VERY early development, and there is no gurantee that I will finish anything here.
